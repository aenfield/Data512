# README: DATA 512, A2: Bias in Data

## Goal
The goal of this project is to explore bias using the number and quality of Wikipedia articles about politicians, by country. 

The instructions for this assignment are documented [on the course wiki](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/HCDS_(Fall_2017)/Assignments#A2:_Bias_in_data).

## Implementation

To reproduce the analysis or review assumptions, run or examine the code in the [hcds-a2-bias.ipynb](hcds-a2-bias.ipynb) notebook.

## Data

I used three data sources:

- [Politicans by country, from English Wikipedia](https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449). This data set, generated by Oliver Keyes, includes "data on most English-language Wikipedia articles within the category "Category:Politicians by nationality" and subcategories, along with the code used to generate that data". The code and data are licensed using the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. The data itself, after extracting from the downloaded file obtained from the link above, is saved in the repo as page_data.csv.
- [Country population, as of mid-2015, from the Population Reference Bureau](http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=14). Per a comment from Oliver on the class Slack forum, I'm noting here that there's no license specified for this data on the PRB site, and that, as with all data published in the US, the data is copyrighted, presumably here by the PRB. Also per Oliver, I haven't saved the data in the repo - the code downloads it if it doesn't already exist locally.
- [Article quality scores, from ORES](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES). ORES provides a [web service interface](https://ores.wikimedia.org/v3/#!/scoring) on top of an ML model that gives any Wikipedia article one of six quality levels. The code uses this API to retrieve article quality scores for all of the Wikipedia articles. The article quality scores are released under the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, per a comment from Oliver on the course Slack forum.


# Fields in the output data file

The final data file is persisted in the repo as [en-wikipedia-politician-scores.csv](en-wikipedia-politician-scores.csv) and has the following fields.

| Column      	      	  | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| country     | Country of article/politician. |
| article_name | Wikipedia article title - most often this is the politician name, but it can sometimes be a description. | 
| revision_id  | The Wikipedia [revision ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Revision_id) for this article. This was the most recent revision ID at the time Oliver generated the article data described above. |
| article_quality      | Article quality score, obtained from the [ORES scoring API](https://ores.wikimedia.org/v3/#/scoring), for the specified revision ID. |
| population  | The population of this country as of mid-2015, from the PRB data source described above. |
