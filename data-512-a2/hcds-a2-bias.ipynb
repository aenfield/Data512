    "Overall, I did find high representation of wealthy and Western countries, which might be evidence that Wikipedia is biased toward covereage from countries like these. However, the differences in population makes it hard to compare all countries straight up, so I did an additional analylsis including just countries with relatively large populations. In addition, if I wanted to make statements about bias I think I would want to adjust for other factors - for example, the size of the government in relation to the population, how long the country has existed, and so on - to feel more confident that I wasn't seeing the effect of other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, going into this analysis, based on discussions in class, I expected that I'd see heavy representation of wealthy and Western countries in the 'top 10' lists - for example, I'd see the US, Canada, and countries in western Europe. Generally, what I actually saw in the top 10 lists were countries with small populations and with small numbers of articles. For example, the most populous country in the top 10 list of countries by articles per person is Iceland, with a population of only 330,000. Eight of the other nine countries each have populations that are less than 80,000. Considering the top 10 list of high quality articles per all articles, only Romania and Ireland are in the top 25 countries by number of articles: the other eight countries have small numbers of articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think accepting the over-representation of countries with small populations and small numbers of articles in the top 10 lists as meaningful might be an example of [\"insensitivity to sample size\"](http://dataremixed.com/2015/01/avoiding-data-pitfalls-part-2/).. This cognitive bias comes from not keeping in mind that it's easier for samples or populations with small sizes to have larger variances. If a country has a small population, only a small number of articles can make for a relatively large articles per person number. Countries with small numbers of articles similarly can end up with large high quality proportions from just a few high quality articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the bottom 10 countries in articles per person include many countries with very large populations, including four countries that are in the top 10 countries in population: China, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Countries with large populations have to 'work hard' to get to a higher articles-per-person proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because comparing large countries to small countries directly is a bit of an apples and oranges problem, I also did some follow-on analysis by looking at the rankings for only 'large' countries - I did the same analysis including only countries with populations over 50 million. The full lists are at [Large countries, articles per person](#Large-countries,-articles-per-person) and [Large countries, high quality articles per all articles](#Large-countries,-high-quality-articles-per-all-articles). These lists show what I originally expected: for the most part, wealthy Western countries rank higher while poorer and non-Western countries rank lower. For example, four of the top five countries in articles per person are in western Europe, and all of the bottom nine countries are in Asia or Africa. The division isn't so stark for the high quality article proportion, with single countries from North America, Europe, Asia, and two countries from Africa in the top five. However, when you take into account the number of articles for each of these countries, only the the US and UK have relatively large numbers of articles - around 1000 each - while the other three countries have much smaller numbers of articles - 142, 187, and 237. Because the number of articles is the denominator in the metric calculation, it's easier for a country with a small number of articles to end up with a high proportion, as we see with the African and Asian countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a different topic, another interesting element that might affect these numbers, and make it harder to detect bias without further work, are other factors that could change the prevalence of articles about politicians. If we wanted to find bias, we probably would want to correct for as many of these additional factors as we could. For example, does the degree to which government itself is 'big' or 'small' in each particular country affect the number of articles about politicians? If a country has a relatively large number of politicians for its size (in real life, not in Wikipedia), does that make it 'easier' or more likely for the country to have relatively more participation in Wikipedia for articles about politicians? Or, what about how long the country has been around? Anecdotally, some countries - for example, the UK - appear to have (many?) articles about politicians that were in office even hundreds of years ago. Perhaps newer countries simply haven't had the time to build up large numbers of articles about politicians? And these are just examples: there could be many similar confounding factors."
