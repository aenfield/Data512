    "In this project I used Bayesian multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP), and Python and [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) to adjust an unrepresentative sample of election preferences and predict the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election. My results don't match the survey from which I used the raw data, possibly because I haven't used enough predictors (in the interest of simplicity). Nonetheless, the code and explanation show an attempt at learning and applying MRP using a language and MCMC framework that I haven't found used for such a purpose before. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** I'm new to this concept and PyMC3, and did this work without review. I also spent a relatively minimal amount of time on this project, as it was just a portion of the work for a particular class. If you happen upon this project and see things I did incorrectly or can do better, please let me know - it'll help me continue to learn. There's a non-exhaustive list of many things that I could do to improve this work in the Discussion section at the end of the paper."

    "Most statistics assume implicitly or explicitly that the sample on which the statistic or inference is applied is _representative_ of the population of interest. I've found personally at least that this assumption is often violated: to a first approximation, I'm more likely to be correct when I assume that a sample is _not representative_.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unrepresentative sample can cause the results based on the sample to be incorrect, and can have other bad effects, including missing signal from under-represented groups (for example, people that are harder to find in order to sample). The degree to which this is a problem in practice depends, at least, on the degree to which the sample is not representative and on the importance of the inference made based on the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a properly-run randomized controlled trial (RCT) can guarantee a representative sample, it's not always practical to run such an experiment. Furthermore, requiring an RCT automatically excludes numerous convenience or other samples. This is especially unfortunate given the explosion in recent years of accessible data that likely contains information but that isn't known to be representative of a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to adjust unrepresentative data after the fact and generate results that more closely hew to the results that would have been obtained from a representative sample. This isn't a silver bullet, and can be difficult, but when done successfully it can make results more useful. The New York Times article [How One 19-Year-Old Illinois Man Is Distorting National Polling Averages](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html) describes general issues with unrepresentative samples as well as with adjusting these samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, two of multiple methods that can be used to adjust samples are [propensity score matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching) and [post-stratification](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat506/node/29). I use post-stratification in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, post-stratification involves three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dividing the population into \"cells\", one for each combination of values in the variables of interest. For example, in this notebook I know the sex, race/ethnicity, and state for each respondent. The Pew Research Center source data (documented in the [README](README.md)) has two values for sex, five values for race/ethnicity, and 51 values for state (including the District of Columbia). This makes for 2 x 5 x 51 = 510 combinations of values, or cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each cell, estimating the statistic in question for observations with the characteristics for that cell and finding the proportion of the overall population in that cell. I estimate the probability of people with the particular combination of sex, race/ethnicity, and state expressing a preference for Trump, with the complement of that probability being the preference for Clinton, using the Pew Research Center poll data. I obtain the proportion of the US population for each cell from the US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). Then, I calculate the contribution of that cell to the overall statistic by multiplying the estimated statistic and the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the final estimate as an average of all cells, weighted by the population in each cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I use a particular approach called \"multi-level regression and post-stratification\" (MRP), which is distinguished by its use of Bayesian multi-level (or hierarchical) regression. As related to the previous steps, this is the particular implementation of the \"estimate the statistic in question\" part of step two above. Bayesian regression uses models where the regression coefficients are defined as parameters to be estimated based on the observed data as well as pre-chosen probability distributions using Bayes' Rule. The \"multi-level\" part of the implementation refers to the use of additional parameters that are also estimated and that are \"above\" or shared by multiple lower-level parameters. The model defined below, for example, defines a regression coefficient/parameter for each state, as well as a higher level \"hyper\" parameter that is shared by all states. The value of this higher level parameter depends on the values of all of the lower level parameters, generally in proportion to the amount of data associated with each lower level parameter. As a result, parameters associated with smaller amounts of data are automatically - by Bayes' Rule - \"shrunk\" toward the mean value, while parameters associated with more data are defined primarily by the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that while Bayesian multi-level regression has advantages, any approach - including simple OLS logistic regression - could be used to find the estimate, and in fact I compare results from both Bayesian regression and OLS logistic regression below.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRP has been implemented and popularized by academics including Andrew Gelman, and others, including via the following papers and blog posts (this is a non-exhaustive list):\n",
    "- [Forecasting elections with non-representative polls](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf); Wang, Rothschild, Goel, Gelman.\n",

    "There are a variety of libraries and packages for doing Bayesian inference and analysis. In this project I use [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3), which is a \"Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms.\""

    "Describing Bayesian inference and MCMC generally is outside the scope of this paper, but I will try to summarize the model briefly.

    "The next block of code defines the model using PyMC3. The model includes a 'mu' parameter that is just the result of a  typical linear equation, with an alpha/intercept, and with a coefficient for each indicator variable (in this example, one of 57 variables: one for sex, five for race/ethnicity, and 51 for state). These coefficients are named beta_sex, beta_race (an array of size five), and beta_state (an array of size 51).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every PyMC3 model needs to tie the parameters to the data. This model connects the result of the mu parameter, transformed using the standard logistic function (so the result is a probability from 0 to 1) and named 'theta', to the data using a Bernoulli likelihood function. Because of this linkage, when PyMC3 generates the MCMC chain the values of the parameters are those that are likely given the data (and the model structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this model defines shared hierarchical 'hyper' parameters, called 'mu_race' and 'mu_state'. These parameters define the prior distribution for all of the beta_race and beta_state parameters, respectively. This structure shares information between all race and state parameters, so that, for example, data from one state informs the values for all other states. This information sharing happens in proportion to the amount of data for each value - that is, states, for example, that have many observations contribute more to the shared and general state parameter while states that have little or no observations contribute minimally or not at all. Furthermore, state-specific coefficient parameters for states that have lots of data are informed minimally by the shared parameter, and state-specific coefficient parameters for states that have little to no data are defined primarily by the shared hyper parameter. Put differently, parameters for which I have a lot of data - say, the beta_state parameter for California - are defined mainly by the data. Parameters for which I have little or no data - like Montana, South Dakota, etc. - are defined primarily by the value of the shared hyper parameter.\n",

The vote data, from the November 2016 monthly data set, contains a row per person surveyed, with the person's sex, race/ethnicity, state, and whether the person voted in the most recent election - this voted data is only available in the \"monthly\" data sets, and is not in the ASEC 2016 data set I used previously.

    "Ideally, the estimate I calculated using one of the Bayesian MRP models would be close to the estimate from the Pew poll. This isn't the case: all of the models I tried provide estimates that have Clinton favored by about an additional three percentage points over the Pew poll. My first guess at why this is happening is that I'm simply not stratifying on enough of the important variables to fully adjust the unrepresentative sample and make it representative. Based on the documentation provided with the Pew data, the Pew results are weighted by eight separate features: \"sex, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region (U.S. Census definitions), population density, and telephone usage\". Of these I currently only stratify based on two - sex and race. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also interesting that the estimates from the very simple OLS logistic regression model are so close to the estimates from the Bayesian models. One of the benefits of a Bayesian hierarchical model is that it shares data between similar features, and this can be especially useful in cases where there is a little or no data for particular features. This property is known as 'shrinkage' because it shrinks estimates toward the value common across the data. I would have expected that this would be helpful in this project because the poll data is minimal, for example, for many states. However, the difference in the Clinton and Trump proportions are small enough, and close enough to a coin flip of 50%, that the shrinkage isn't easy to see. (It's not that shrinkage isn't working entirely - in the [ProjectResearch](ProjectResearch.ipynb) notebook I tested some artifical data with 1/3 and 2/3 proportions and reliably saw shrinkage for cells with little data to the 1/3 and 2/3 values.)

    "Based at least on what I've found in this project, post-stratifying an unrepresentative sample using a Bayesian multi-level regression model shows promise and should be possible, but it's not something that I at least was able to do in a relatively short time. Nonetheless, this notebook and the code in this repository at least provide a full example - from data to results - that shows how to use MRP with election data, and does so using \"full\" Bayesian inference with MCMC (as opposed to a simpler approach that, for example, just provides maximum likelihood estimates).\n",

    "- As noted previously, I'd like to see if using additional fields improves the performance. The data from the ASEC 2016 data set includes many fields that could help, including age, 'density' (population density of the state), region (Census region), income, and highest level of school/highest degree. \n",
    "- Right now the handling of the propensity to vote and of voters with preferences besides Clinton and Trump might be insufficient. For example, the Xbox paper describes using two models: one that predicts whether a person is going to vote for the main candidates and then one that predicts the preference for those voters.\n",
    "- The full Bayesian approach provides a lot of additional data on the variability/uncertainty in things like probabilities. For example, it shows that the uncertainty can vary substantially by cell. It would be interesting to try to incorporate estimates of variability into the results.\n",
    "- The diagnostics for my MCMC sample could probably be better. For example, the mixing for many of the parameters isn't great. Can I fix this via changing the model? To what degree, really, is this a problem with this project?\n",
    "- In terms of the model, do I need an intercept? Does removing the intercept affect the performance? Does it help with sampling?"
